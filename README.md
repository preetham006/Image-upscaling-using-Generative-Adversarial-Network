# Image-upscaling-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network
Image upscaling using GAN (RRDN) enhances low-resolution images by generating high-resolution versions with fine details. RRDN (Residual-in-Residual Dense Network) uses deep residual and dense connections to retain textures. Itâ€™s trained on HR-LR pairs. The GAN discriminator boosts realism. Ideal for media, surveillance, and medical imaging.
