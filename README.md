# Image-upscaling-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network

Below is a README file tailored for your GitHub repository, describing the Image Upscaling project using the Residual in Residual Dense Network (RRDN), a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The README is written in Markdown and includes sections for project description, installation, usage, and other relevant details.

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the **Residual in Residual Dense Network (RRDN)**, a deep learning model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) designed for high-quality image super-resolution. The model upscales low-resolution images to higher resolutions (e.g., 4x upscaling) while preserving fine details and textures.

## Project Overview

The RRDN architecture leverages **Residual Dense Blocks (RDBs)** and **Residual in Residual Dense Blocks (RRDBs)** to learn hierarchical features for super-resolution tasks. This implementation is inspired by advanced models like ESRGAN, focusing on generating high-quality, visually appealing upscaled images. The code is modular, reusable, and optimized for performance using PyTorch.

## Features

- **RRDN Architecture**: Combines residual learning and dense connections for robust feature extraction.
- **Flexible Upscaling**: Supports configurable scaling factors (e.g., 4x upscaling).
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Easy-to-use and customizable for research or practical applications.
- **Modular Design**: Includes reusable components like Residual Dense Blocks (RDB) and RRDB.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-enabled GPU (optional, for faster training/inference)
- Additional dependencies: `torchvision`, `numpy`, `pillow`

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/preetham006/Image-upscaling-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network.git
   cd Image-upscaling-using-Generative-Adversarial-Network
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy pillow
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Place low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs in a dataset directory.
   - Example dataset structure:
     ```
     dataset/
     ├── train/
     │   ├── LR/
     │   ├── HR/
     ├── test/
     │   ├── LR/
     │   ├── HR/
     ```

2. **Run Training**:
   Modify the training script (e.g., `train.py`) to point to your dataset and configure hyperparameters. Example command:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data-dir dataset/ --scale 4 --epochs 100 --batch-size 16
   ```

3. **Model Checkpoint**:
   Trained model weights will be saved in the `checkpoints/` directory.

### Inference

To upscale images using a pre-trained model:
```bash
python inference.py --model checkpoints/rrdn_model.pth --input input_lr_image.png --output output_hr_image.png --scale 4
```

### Example

```bash
python inference.py --model checkpoints/rrdn_model.pth --input samples/lr_image.png --output samples/hr_image.png --scale 4
```

This will take a low-resolution image (`lr_image.png`), upscale it by 4x, and save the result as `hr_image.png`.
